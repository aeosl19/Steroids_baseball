    "Since the 90s has - as any other sport - has had its issues with steroids. If we disregard the ethics of taking a unnatural perfomance enhancer and only consider the possible danger both to the players health and risks of beeing caught - why would a player take a banned substance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously a player would take a banned substance in the hope of prolonging a career or improving enough to make it to - and stay in the MLB. Therefore the question of taking a banned substance boils down to a players worth. So how can we do that? There are several factor contributing to a players worth but excluding pitchers hits are probably by far the most important metric. So, to begin answering the question of why steroids I've choosen to look at the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the mean income for an mlb player from 1990 until today compared to players caught taking steroids \n",
    "- Except pitchers, hits are the biggest factor in determening a players salary. But what is the relationship between salaries and hits? Is there a strong link?."
